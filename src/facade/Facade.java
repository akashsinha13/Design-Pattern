      A facade is for hiding features/internal complexity from external clients
      and to give them a unified access point to public functionality.

      The best example is AppStore where we can order an app
      and we do not have to know what happens in the background: the app is developed
      and tested. And we are happy that we donâ€™t have to call every phase of the development
      life-cycle, just the one facade.
